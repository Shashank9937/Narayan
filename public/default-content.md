## FOUNDATION PRINCIPLES

### The Only Metrics That Matter
- **Month 0-3:** Customer conversations per week (target: 25+)
- **Month 4-6:** Weekly Active Users (WAU) or Revenue
- **Month 7-9:** Month-over-Month Growth Rate (target: 15%+)
- **Month 10-12:** ARR or GMV run-rate (target: $2M-4M for strong Series A)

### Core Truths
1. **Ideas are worthless, execution is everything** - You'll pivot 2-3 times
2. **Speed compounds** - 80% done today > 100% done next month
3. **Traction forgives all sins** - Growth solves fundraising, hiring, everything
4. **Talk to users obsessively** - 5 convos/day minimum during validation
5. **Burn = runway = time = only resource** - Optimize for time, not money saved

## IDEA GENERATION ENGINE

### Method 1: Personal Expertise + Market Gaps
**Process:**
1. List 10 industries you know deeply
2. For each: What's broken? What wastes time? What's manual?
3. Cross-reference with: AI trends, regulatory changes, new behaviors

**Best For:** B2B SaaS, vertical software, professional tools

---

### Method 2: Trend Intersection
**Formula:** [Emerging Tech] x [Proven Business Model] x [Growing Market]

**Examples:**
- AI x LinkedIn x Recruiting = AI recruiting platform
- Blockchain x Uber x Logistics = Decentralized delivery
- Computer Vision x Shopify x Manufacturing = Visual quality control

**Process:**
1. List 5 emerging technologies
2. List 10 proven business models
3. List 10 growing markets
4. Create 50 combinations
5. Evaluate each

---

### Method 3: Services-to-Software
**Process:**
1. Find fragmented service industries (legal, accounting, recruiting, etc.)
2. Identify manual, repetitive tasks
3. Build software to automate or scale

**Best For:** B2B, high-margin SaaS, clear ROI

---

### Method 4: Copycat + Localize
**Process:**
1. Find successful models in other markets
2. Adapt to: Different geography, industry, or customer segment
3. Execute faster and better

**Examples:**
- Uber for X -> Every vertical
- Stripe for Y -> Every geography or use case

---

### Method 5: Pain Mining
**Process:**
1. Join 10 subreddits, Slack groups, forums in target industries
2. Search for: "I hate", "frustrated", "wish there was"
3. Document 50 painful problems
4. Rank by frequency and intensity

**Best For:** Consumer apps, PLG products

---

### Method 6: Follow the Money
**Process:**
1. Find industries with high spend on X
2. Build: Better/cheaper/faster X
3. Capture: Even 1% of existing spend = huge market

**Examples:**
- Enterprise spend $200B on salespeople -> Sales automation tools
- Companies spend $50B on customer support -> Support AI

---

- "Why didn't that work?"
- "How much time/money does this cost you?"

**Ideal Future (3 min)**

- "What features are must-have vs nice-to-have?"

**Buying Intent (2 min)**
- "If I built this, would you be interested?"
- "Would you pay for this?"
- "How much?" (let them answer first)
- "Can I follow up when we have something?"

**VALIDATION CRITERIA:**
- ✓ 80%+ confirm this is a real, painful problem
- ✓ 50%+ express strong willingness to pay

**Close (3 min)**
- "We're launching in 4 weeks to first 10 customers"
- "Would you be one of them?"
- "Here's the pricing: [options]"
- "Can I put you down for [package]?"

**VALIDATION CRITERIA:**

- ✓ 25%+ commit to buy (verbal or written)
- ✓ 5+ actually pay deposit or full price
- ✓ Feedback is specific and actionable

**IF FAIL:**
- <25% excitement -> Wrong solution or wrong customers

---

### PHASE 3: DEMAND VALIDATION (Week 4, Budget: $500)

**Landing Page Test:**

2. 3 key benefits (outcome-focused)
3. Social proof (even if "joining 500+ on waitlist")

- Budget: $500 split across 5 ad variations
- Duration: 5-7 days
- Goal: Email signups

**SUCCESS METRICS:**
- Landing page conversion: 5%+ -> Good fit
- Cost per lead: <$5 -> Cheap acquisition
- Email quality: 50%+ open rate on follow-up -> Right audience

**IF FAIL:**
- <2% conversion -> Value prop unclear or wrong audience
- >$20 cost per lead -> Acquisition will be too expensive
- <20% email engagement -> Wrong people signing up
- **ACTION:** Rewrite value prop OR change targeting OR kill idea

---

### KILL CRITERIA (End of Month 2):

**Kill the idea if ANY of these are true:**
1. <5 people willing to pay real money
2. <40% of interviewees say this is a top-3 priority problem
3. No clear customer segment (everyone is a potential customer = no one is)
4. You're not excited to work on this for 3 years
5. Can't get to $2M ARR in realistic scenario

**It's better to kill and restart than to build the wrong thing.**

---

## MVP EXECUTION ROADMAP

### PHILOSOPHY: MVP = Minimum VIABLE Product
- Viable = Customers get value and pay
- Not minimum features
- Not pretty
- Not scalable
- JUST: Does it solve the core problem?

---

### MVP SCOPING FRAMEWORK

**Step 1: Define the Core Job**
- What is the ONE thing this product must do?
- Example: Uber = "Get car to pick me up"
- Example: Stripe = "Accept payment on website"
- **Your core job: ___________**

**Step 2: User Story Mapping**
List steps user takes to complete core job:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. ...

**For each step, ask:**
- Can this be manual? (You doing it behind scenes?)
- Can this be automated later?
- Is this core or nice-to-have?

**Step 3: Ruthless Feature Cut**
Start with: Every feature idea
Cut: Everything that's not essential to core job
Keep cutting: Until you can build it in 4 weeks

**The Test:**
- If you remove this feature, does the product still solve the problem?
- If yes -> CUT IT
- If no -> Keep it

**Step 4: Tech Stack Decision**

**Decision Tree:**
- Can you pre-sell and deliver manually? -> Do that (Week 1-2)
- Can you use no-code (Webflow, Airtable, Zapier)? -> Do that (Week 2-3)
- Must you code? -> Use fastest framework you know

**Best Stacks for Speed:**
- Full-stack: Next.js + Supabase + Vercel
- Mobile: React Native + Firebase
- No-code: Webflow + Airtable + Zapier/Make
- AI app: OpenAI API + Python + Streamlit

**DON'T:**
- Learn new framework for MVP
- Optimize for scale (you'll pivot anyway)
- Overthink architecture

---

**Week 3-4: Term Sheets and Negotiation**

**Term Sheet Key Terms:**

**Economics:**
- **Valuation:** Pre-money or post-money?
- **Investment amount:** How much cash?
- **Pro-rata rights:** Can they invest in next round?

**Control:**
- **Board composition:** Founders, investors, independent?
- **Protective provisions:** What requires investor approval?
- **Voting rights:** How are decisions made?

**Liquidation:**
- **Liquidation preference:** 1x non-participating (standard) vs participating (bad for you)
- **Anti-dilution:** Weighted average (fair) vs full ratchet (bad for you)

**Other:**
- **Option pool:** % reserved for employees (comes from founder shares)
- **Drag-along:** Can investors force sale?
- **No-shop:** How long are you locked in?

**Negotiation Strategy:**
1. **Get multiple term sheets** (FOMO = leverage)
2. **Don't optimize for valuation** -> Optimize for: partner quality, terms, speed
3. **Ask for references** -> Talk to other founders they've invested in
4. **Push back on bad terms** -> Participating preferred, >1x liquidation preference, full ratchet
5. **Get legal counsel** -> Hire experienced startup lawyer ($500-1000/hr but worth it)

**Decision Framework:**
- **Tier 1 investor + fair terms + strong support** -> Take it
- **Tier 2 investor + great terms + okay support** -> Maybe
- **Tier 3 investor + bad terms + poor support** -> Pass (even if you're desperate)

---

**RED FLAGS in Investors:**
- 🚩 No clear partner champion
- 🚩 Negative founder references
- 🚩 Slow to move / lots of asks
- 🚩 Pushes for excessive control or bad terms
- 🚩 Doesn't understand your market

### DECISION FRAMEWORK

**For Every Major Decision:**

**1. One-Way vs Two-Way Door**
- One-way (hard to reverse): Hiring co-founder, choosing market, raising money
  - Take time, get advice, be deliberate
- Two-way (easy to reverse): Pricing, marketing channel, feature prioritization
  - Move fast, test, iterate

**2. ROI on Time**
- What's the expected return on investing time here?
- Will this move key metrics this month?
- If no: Delegate, delay, or delete

**3. Reversibility Test**
- Can I undo this in <1 month?
- Yes -> Do it
- No -> Think harder

**4. Regret Minimization**
- Will I regret not trying this?
- Helps with: Taking risks, pivoting, firing

**5. The Eisenhower Matrix**

|  | Urgent | Not Urgent |
|---|---|---|
| **Important** | Do now (Sales, critical bugs, payroll) | Schedule (Strategy, learning, relationships) |
| **Not Important** | Delegate (Most meetings, emails, admin) | Eliminate (Busy work, social media rabbit holes) |

### ENERGY MANAGEMENT

**High-Energy Activities:**
- Customer conversations
- Strategic planning
- Fundraising pitches

**Cap Table Should Look Like:**
- Founders: 60-80%
- Angels/pre-seed: 10-20%
- Option pool: 10-15%
- Advisors: 1-3%

**Red Flags:**
- Founders own <50% pre-Series A
- Too many small angel investors (>20)
- Messy terms (different share classes, weird rights)
- Advisor with >2%

**Clean Up:**
- Consolidate: Small angels into SPV (special purpose vehicle)

- Document: Everything properly

---

### TAXES & COMPLIANCE

---

## DECISION FRAMEWORKS

### FRAMEWORK 1: THE PIVOT DECISION

**When to Consider Pivoting:**
- No traction after 3 months of execution
- Can't get to $10K MRR in 12 months
- Customer feedback consistently negative
- You've lost conviction

**The Pivot Matrix:**

| | Same Customer | Different Customer |
|---|---|---|
| **Same Problem** | Tweak solution, pricing, positioning | Probably wrong problem |
| **Different Problem** | Customer pivot (easier) | Full pivot (hardest) |

**Decision Process:**
1. **Data check:** What do metrics say?
2. **Customer check:** What do 10 customers say?
3. **Gut check:** Are you still excited?
4. **Market check:** Is there a there there?

**If 3/4 are negative -> Pivot**
**If 2/4 are negative -> Give it 2 more weeks, then decide**

---

### FRAMEWORK 2: HIRING DECISIONS

**Should You Hire for This Role?**

**The ROI Test:**
- What revenue/value will this person generate?
- Is it 5x their cost?
- If not: Don't hire, outsource instead

**Hire When:**
- You've done the job yourself and understand it
- You have repeatable processes to hand off
- Revenue or funding supports it
- It's a high-leverage role

**Don't Hire When:**
- You're just overwhelmed (hire help, not employees)
- Role is unclear
- Can't afford 18 months of salary
- You haven't proven product-market fit

**First 5 Hires (in order):**
1. **Engineer** (if you're non-technical founder)
2. **Sales/BizDev** (to free you up)
3. **Customer Success** (to retain customers)
4. **Second Engineer** (to ship faster)
5. **Marketing/Growth** (to scale acquisition)

---

### FRAMEWORK 3: FEATURE PRIORITIZATION

**The RICE Score:**
- **Reach:** How many users will this impact? (1-1000+)
- **Impact:** How much will it improve their experience? (1-3)
- **Confidence:** How sure are you? (0.5-1.0)
- **Effort:** How many person-weeks? (0.5-10+)

**Score = (Reach x Impact x Confidence) / Effort**

**Example:**
- Feature A: (1000 x 3 x 0.8) / 2 = 1200
- Feature B: (100 x 3 x 1.0) / 0.5 = 600
- Build Feature A first

---

### FRAMEWORK 4: PRICING DECISIONS

**Value-Based Pricing:**
1. What's the economic value to customer?
2. Charge: 10-20% of that value
3. Or: 3x your cost to deliver

**Price Testing:**
- Test: Increase price by 20% for new customers
- Measure: Conversion rate change
- If conversion drops <10% -> Keep new price
- Repeat until conversion drops >20%

**Pricing Models:**
- **Usage-based:** Pay for what you use (AWS, Twilio)
- **Tiered:** Good/Better/Best (Slack, HubSpot)
- **Flat rate:** One price, unlimited use
- **Per seat:** Per user pricing (Zoom, Figma)

**Best for Early Stage:**
- Start simple: Flat rate or basic tiers
- Test aggressively: Change prices monthly
- Optimize: For revenue, not conversion rate

---

## FINAL WORD

**This system works if you:**
1. Execute with discipline
2. Talk to customers obsessively
3. Move fast and iterate
4. Focus on traction above all else
5. Are willing to pivot when data says so

**The Formula:**
- **Months 1-3:** Find problem worth solving
- **Months 4-6:** Prove people will pay
- **Months 7-9:** Find repeatable growth
- **Months 10-12:** Scale like crazy

**Success = Speed x Focus x Execution**

You have 12 months. Make them count.
